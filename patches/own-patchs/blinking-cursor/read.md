Change cursor shapes in your shells. For example, below is for zsh and it is
located in .zshrc.

```sh
# Change cursor shape for different vi modes.
function zle-keymap-select () {
    case $KEYMAP in
        vicmd) echo -ne '\e[1 q';;      # block
        viins|main) echo -ne '\e[5 q';; # beam
    esac
}
zle -N zle-keymap-select

zle-line-init() {
    zle -K viins # initiate `vi insert` as keymap (can be removed if `bindkey -V` has been set elsewhere)
    echo -ne "\e[5 q"
}
zle -N zle-line-init
```
